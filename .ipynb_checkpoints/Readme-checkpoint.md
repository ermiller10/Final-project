# Final Project Proposal
## Project Requirements
### Read in a real dataset: I found a dataset on the USGS site that compared the sediment build up and carbon burial of a variety of coastal wetlands in Tampa Bay. The data was contextualized by three regional categorizations including mature mangroves, young mangroves, and salt marshes. Ten sediment cores were taken in 2015; lead-210 and celsium-137 isotopes were analyzed to reconstruct how accretion and carbon burial rates have changed over the past century. 

### Manipulate data: I plan to find  I will perform standard deviation test of the data to identify if there are any uncertanties in variation. With data trends stipulated about the past century it may be possible and relevant to project this data into predictions for the next century.

### Visualization: The data is attributed to geographic locations (long. and lat. datat) It would be interesting to place the data on a map and provide geospatial visualization, but this may beyond my scope. For the visualization of data that does not interpret temporal relations it would be good to use a scatterplot. There are a lot of data points, so this would be best for finding trends. Because the regions are all local to Tampa Bay, it would be good to use a pie chart to show the portion of carbon being sequestered by the different regions.

### Introduce a new skill: To use the Python predict () function would be a skill that I have not yet practiced. The function accepts only a single argument. It returns the labels of the data passed as argument based on the learned data obtained from the model.

## Summary of analysis: Important to my analysis will be finding correlations between sediment accumulation and carbon sequestration and the type of vegetation. The visualization of the data sets may show significant differences in the age of mangrove forests and the sediment accumulation data, providing valuable information about coastal protection. Projections of the carbon sequestration and accumulation data into the next century can give me an idea of if these trends are reasonable and sustainable.
